   ####The grow effect on your profile image covers up your header text awkwardly, so I'd adjust either the spacing or the size of the animation.
   #### I'd recommend splitting your site into a few different pages, all part of your nav menu: Home, Resume, Projects, Contact
       #### Put the PDF view of your resume on your resume page, not in the nav bar
   #### Move your contact information into a footer and/or separate contact page
    #### Remove the line of "Everything here can be found" from your footer - that should be main body text
    #### Delete the icons from the footer, and remove the line about the trademark
   #### Remove "A full stack developer" from your nav 
   #### I would add a short bio that is more robust than the breakfast and tacos line for before the Annapolis, Leader, Developer section
   #### The image on your resume page should be right below the nav bar - remove the section that currently has your contact and "How did I get here"
   #### The vertical column organization of your resume is hard to follow. I would have the projects, professional experience, and other pieces be 100% width as their own sections organized in a vertical scroll
   #### Again, pull the full description of your project work into a separate projects page
  ####  In terms of styling:
     ####   See if you can mix up from straight black and white to pretty it up
     #####   Work on spacing out your page sections more naturally, so we see a break between different sections. A simple <hr> as a starting point will show what I'm talking about.
     ####  I don't love the font choice
      ####  Introduce some variety in your levels of headers beyond just size: bold, italics, color - help the viewer differentiate each separate level more clearly
      ####  Introduce some sort of colored or image background to make the footer stand out from the main body text
